# Stegoji

High School Cyber Project

Stegoji was developed as a high school cyber project. It aims to explore the concepts of encryption, steganography, and their practical implementation in Python. The project serves as an educational tool for understanding fundamental cryptography principles in a fun and engaging way.
Stegoji is a Python-based tool for text encryption and steganography using emojis. It allows you to hide encrypted messages within emoji strings, providing a fun and creative way to communicate securely.

## Features

- Encrypt plain text messages using emojis as encryption keys
- Embed encrypted messages within emoji strings (steganography)
- Extract encrypted messages from steganographic emoji strings
- Decrypt and recover the original plain text messages
